"""
Test doubles shared across the irp_integration test suite.

Every test runs offline. Nothing constructs a real ``Client``, so no environment
variables, no credentials and no network access are involved. ``FakeClient``
records each ``request()`` call, which is what lets the write tests assert on the
request body, method and path rather than only on the return value.
